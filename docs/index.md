# The Ideascube CI deployment

These pages document how we deployed our CI environment.

This setup allows us to publish
[package repositories for Debian](http://repos.ideas-box.org/debian/)

The following pages document how it all works:

# [Buildbot](buildbot.md)
# [Debian Packaging](debian-packaging.md)
